                        We aspire to provide a stimulating and nurturing environment where all children can learn through play. Our educators will support and scaffold a child's emerging skills in a way which will help them to become life-long learners. Our Educators understand how to support children in their social and autonomy development. Educators do this by assisting them to develop a strong sense of wellbeing in readiness for school. The emphasis in our room is for each child to have fun, feel safe and secure and form trusting relationships within the room.
